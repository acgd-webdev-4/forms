# Forms & fields

## Overview

- *Continue work on your `ecommerce-pattern-library`*
- **We’re not styling the form page this week—we’re styling the individual form inputs and fields.**
- Figure out all the different form fields needed for your checkout form and style them individually—each form field in its own HTML file:
  - Text inputs?
  - Labels?
  - Email inputs?
  - Date pickers?
  - Text areas?
  - Checkboxes? Should they be custom designed?
  - Radio buttons? Should they be custom designed?
  - Are there questions with large chunks of text? How do those look?
  - Fieldsets?
  - Different sizes?
- You can group *some* inputs together, if their association is special, to show how they should be designed, like username/password fields—*but remember you’re not making the page, so you won’t likely need too many of these.*
- Style the error messages & validation states too for when the form wasn’t filled in properly.
- **Don’t use the `<form>` tag at all—we’ll be combining each field piece together into a `<form>` later when we build pages.**

## Details

- *How many patterns?:* It’s completely up to you—it’s your website design. Call the teacher over if you want confirmation.
- *Multi-file:* Each different type and functional form field should have its own HTML file—we’re designing components not pages.
- *Do I need to design every possible form input:* Yes.
- *When & why:* In the `config.yml` files describe when to use each new pattern you create.
